    "In purely mathematical terms, convolution is a function derived from two given functions by integration which expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. In simpler (discrete) terms, the convolution product of a matrix by a smaller one can be seen as _filtering_ the large matrix.

    "## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional NNs (CNNs) rely on convolution in place of general matrix multiplication. They are specialized for processing data with a known grid-like topology and are among the best performing systems in classification/recognition tasks. Each layer in a CNN consists in a set of $N$ _filters_ called _kernels_, that are convolved across the input. If we denote as $\\{k^l_n\\}_{n\\in[1;N]}$ the set of kernels for layer $l$, these all share a unique _kernel size_. By convolving each one of its $N$ kernels across a d-dimensional input $x$, a convolutional layer produces $N$ d-dimensional outputs called _feature maps_, denoted as $\\{a^l_n\\}_{n\\in[1;N]}$. Hence, the computation of the $n$-th activation map in layer $l$ for input $x$ is defined as:\n",

    "a^l_n = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} k^l_n \\star x_m + b^l_n\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, as depicted in the following Figure, the feature map corresponding to kernel $n$ consists in the sum of the d-dimensional discrete convolutions (denoted by the $\\star$ operator) between the kernel $n$ and each one of the d-dimensional data $\\{x_m\\}_{m\\in[1;M]}$, plus a bias $b$. A convolutional layer is thus a 3-dimensional tensor $h \\in \\mathcal{T}_{N,I,J}(\\mathbb{R})$ where $N$ is the number of features maps while $I$ and $J$ are respectively the _width_ and _height_ of the maps. \n",
